The dump functions are the initial step in using Upsonic. These functions serialize and prepare the data, sending it to the Upsonic On-Prem system.


To get started, you will need:

- Implemented [connection code](/client/getting_started/connection)



## upsonic.dump

This function is used for dumping a singular item to Upsonic. With this, you can dump a Function, Class, Object, or any Variable. You just need to provide a name with the `key` parameter and assign the element with the `value` parameter.

<ParamField path="key" type="string">
  The virtual and freely chosen path for your dumped value.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="value" type="any_python_thing">
  The value that you want to dump.
</ParamField>


```python
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

upsonic.dump("math.sum", sum)
```
<Info>You can include any class just as it is; no changes are required.</Info>



## upsonic.dump_module

This command is designed to dump an entire library with just one line. You can use it to dump a folder containing your existing library. You only need to provide a 'key' and the 'module' as its 'value' .

<ParamField path="key" type="string">
  The name you want to use in load operations.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="value" type="module">
  The module that you want to dump, including all its contents.
</ParamField>


```python
import random

upsonic.dump_module("random", random)
```
