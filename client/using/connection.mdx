The Upsonic Client communicates with the Upsonic On-Prem API, and this communication requires an access key for authorization. To establish a connection to the API, we need to obtain the `address` and `access_key`. The dashboard provides this information, so you only need to copy and paste.

## Connection
Please copy the connection code from the [Home Page](/on-prem/using/home).Your connection code should look like this:
```python

from upsonic import Upsonic_On_Prem
upsonic = Upsonic_On_Prem('https://your-server-address:5000', 'ACK_****************')
                
```
