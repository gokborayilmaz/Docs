The load function is the final stage in using Upsonic. With this function, you can retrieve your stored items just like the original statements. The load function retrieves and deserializes the items that you previously sent to the Upsonic On-Prem system.

To get started, you will need:

- Implemented [connection code](/client/getting_started/connection)



## upsonic.load

This function is for loading a singular item from Upsonic. With this, you can load a Function, Class, Object, or any Variable. You just need to provide a name with the `key` parameter.

<ParamField path="key" type="string">
  The virtual and freely chosen path for your dumped value
</ParamField>

```python
sum = upsonic.load("math.sum")
sum(1, 2)
```



## upsonic.load_module

This command is designed for loading an entire library with just one line. You only need to provide the `key`.

<ParamField path="key" type="string">
  The name of the library that you want to retrieve.
</ParamField>



```python
math = upsonic.load_module("math")
math.sum(1, 2)

random = upsonic.load_module("random")

random.Random().random()
```
