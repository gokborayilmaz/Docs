## About Client
The Upsonic Client is our only client to making `dump` and `load` operations. It can serialize and send your functions, classes, objects or any variables to Upsonic On-Prem.  With this capability, you can easily create effortless and generative AI-supported librares, ensuring speed and efficiency for your team.

Upsonic solves the spaghetti code and maintenance problems of shared libraries. It allows easy storage, redesign, and delivery through a permission-based infrastructure and modern technologies.
