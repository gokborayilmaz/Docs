# Upsonic v0.18.0



## Search Mechanism [New]
In this version we just added a search infrastructure to easily find anything with your question. 

For this we are using embedding search infrastructure with ollama. You can access and get results by your read permissions and going with just clicking.

Features:
- **Minimum Score Threshold**: Users can specify a minimum score for search results, ensuring that only the most relevant documentation is returned. The closer it is to 1, the more relevant it is.
- **Result Limit**: To manage the volume of information, users have the option to limit the number of results returned by the search.

## OpenAI Model Support [New]
With this version we just add a ability to use `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` instead of `gemma-2b` model. 

For this you just need to add env variabes:
- `openai_api_key`
- `default_model`
