<Warning>Before performing an update, we recommend taking a backup of your **upsonic_on_prem_data** volume.</Warning>


With these instructions, we will update your installation to the latest version that we have released, and you should check for the [latest updatest](https://docs.upsonic.co/on-prem/what_news). We will stop and remove your current container named **upsonic_on_prem** ; the volume and other containers or applications will not be affected.

```console
docker stop upsonic_on_prem
```

```console
docker remove upsonic_on_prem
```

With these commands, your installation will be removed. However, as you know, the volume will remain intact. Now, let's pull the latest image using the `docker pull` command:

```console
docker pull ghcr.io/upsonic/on-prem
```

And finally, we will install and run the latest Upsonic On-Prem:

<Warning>Please check the .env file, and it should be the same as your first installation.</Warning>


```console
docker run --env-file .env -d -p 7501:7501 -p 7500:7500 --name upsonic_on_prem --restart=always -v upsonic_on_prem_data:/var/lib/redis ghcr.io/upsonic/on-prem

```

## Checking
Now, you can access your Upsonic On-Prem via localhost or any other method to connect to your server:
```console
https://localhost:7501
```
