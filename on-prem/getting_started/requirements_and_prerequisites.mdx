The aim of Upsonic On-Prem is to provide easy installation and fault tolerance through its designed system. In this way, everything is packaged in one container.

## Server Requirements
Upsonic On-Prem is designed to work alone; however, some systems in our container may consume a significant amount of CPU and RAM, especially due to the inclusion of machine learning models. 

Therefore, we recommend the following requirements for your server:

- 4 Core CPU
- 8 GB   RAM
- 50 GB   DISK


## Persistent storage
Upsonic On-Prem requires a storage volume to store functions, classes, objects, and variables sent from the Client, as well as user information and generative AI results. By default, Docker does not provide persistent storage for containers, but we recommend setting up an external and persistent volume.

Due to the design and use case, Upsonic On-Prem doesn't require large volume sizes. The functions and other elements we store have very low sizes. Additionally, the dashboard we provide has a small system and a small database.

## Port configuration
Upsonic needs two open ports for the dashboard and API ([Architecture](https://docs.upsonic.co/on-prem/getting_started/architecture)). These ports are essential for client communication and accessing the dashboard.

For Upsonic On-Prem, the following ports must be open:

- TCP port **5001** for Dashboard
- TCP port **5000** for API (for clients)
