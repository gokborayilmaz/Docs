Upsonic On-Prem consists of two subsystems: the Dashboard and the API. Both systems run in a single container and connect internally. This document guides you through the installation and execution of the container without any issues.

To get started, you will need:

- The latest version of Docker installed and functioning properly
- TCP ports 5001 and 5000 ready for use

## Deployment

First, we will create a volume to store everything:

```console
docker volume create upsonic_on_prem_data
```


Setting .env

```console
nano .env
```

```console
admin_key=YOUR_ADMIN_KEY_FOR_API # 123
admin_pass=YOUR_ADMIN_PASS_FOR_DASHBOARD # 123456
admin_username=YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME #upsonic_admin
```

after adjusting the settings, you can exit by pressing Ctrl+X, then confirming with 'Y' and pressing Enter.


Now, let's proceed with the download, installation, and execution of the Upsonic On-Prem container:

```console
docker run --env-file .env -d -p 5001:5001 -p 5000:5000 --name upsonic_on_prem --restart=always -v upsonic_on_prem_data:/var/lib/redis ghcr.io/upsonic/on-prem
```

After that, you should see:
```console
root@server:~# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND          CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                           NAMES
918a4c74185a   ghcr.io/upsonic/on-prem   "bash /run.sh"   11 seconds ago   Up 10 seconds   0.0.0.0:5000-5001->5000-5001/tcp, :::5000-5001->5000-5001/tcp   upsonic_on_prem
```


## Logging In
Now, you can access your Upsonic On-Prem via localhost or any other method of accessing your server:
```console
https://localhost:5001
