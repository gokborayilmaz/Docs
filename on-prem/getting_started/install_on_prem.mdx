## Introduction
Upsonic On-Prem consist two sub system, the Dashboard and the API. Both systems runs in a one container and connects inside. This document helps you for installing and running the container without any problem.

To get started, you will need:

- The latest verson of Docker installed and working
- Ready to use 5001 and 5000 TCP ports 

## Deployment

First we will create a volume to storing everything:

```console
docker volume create upsonic_on_prem_data
```


Setting .env

```console
admin_key=YOUR_ADMIN_KEY_FOR_API # 123
admin_pass=YOUR_ADMIN_PASS_FOR_DASHBOARD # 123456
admin_username=YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME #upsonic_admin
```


Now we will download, install and run the Upsonic On-Prem container:

```console
docker run --env-file .env -d -p 5001:5001 -p 5000:5000 --name upsonic_on_prem --restart=always -v upsonic_on_prem_data:/var/lib/redis ghcr.io/upsonic/on-prem
```

After that you should see:
```console
root@server:~# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND          CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                           NAMES
