## About On-Prem
**Upsonic On-Prem** is our main system designed to organize your modules, create documents, and manage roles. With this system, you can easily create and store shared libraries with automatic documentation generation. This will result in speed and efficiency for your team.

<Note>Upsonic On-Prem does not require a license for up to three users.</Note>

Upsonic solves your spaghetti code and maintenance problems related to shared libraries. It easily stores, redesigns, and delivers with a permission-based infrastructure and modern technologies. Additionally, with elastic dependency, you don't need to make decisions and share plans with others. Upsonic is capable of using different versions of a library in the same Python environment.
