Lbraries is the most important part of our Dashboard. In this page you can access the whole content that seperated by modules. In this point you should get help from the given codes because they are built by content and they are easier way to use Upsonic.

When you perform a [dump operation](/client/using/dump), it is instantly reflected here (just refresh the page) because they share the same database source.

<Note>When you click for the first time on to a content, it takes some time because in the background, the documentation is being generated. So, you should be patient; it will load after the generation process.</Note>



## Inside of an module

In this section, you can see the sub-elements of the top module. In the table, you can observe the subspaces labeled with 'Library' text. Once you see it, you can understand the ability to view inside by clicking.

### Gathering Code

This connection code uses the [upsonic.load_module](/client/using/load#upsonic-load-module) When you use it, you can retrieve all subcontents in just one function as a module type.

## Content of an element
This section contains a lot of information, and we will add new ones as soon as possible. At this point, we are generating documents in the background and providing them here. Additionally, we have a singular retrieval mechanism, showcasing the original code with some actions on this page.


<Warning>If you encounter 'None' for an element in libraries, it is due to permissions. Users should attempt to click on the element, and after the first click, the system will generate the document in the background.</Warning>


## Singular Get Command


This code is designed to retrieve a single element for faster and more efficient API communications. For this purpose, you should refer to the [upsonic.load](/client/using/load#upsonic-load) function.
