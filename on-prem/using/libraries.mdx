Lbraries is the most important part of our Dashboard. In this page you can access the whole content that seperated by modules. In this point you should get help from the given codes because they are built by content and they are easier way to use Upsonic.

When you make a [dump operation](/client/using/dump), its effected instantly to here (just refresh the page). Because they are the same database soure.

<Note>When you click first time to an content its take some times beacuse in the background the documentation is generating. So you should just be patient, its will load after generation.</Note>



## Inside of an module

In this section you can see the sub elements of the top module and in the table you can thee the sub spaces with `Library` text. When you see it you can understand to ability to view inside with click. 

### Gathering Code

This connection code is uses [upsonic.load_module](/client/using/load#upsonic-load-module) function and when you use it you can get all sub contents in just one function as module type.

## Content of an element
This section have many information and we will add new ones as soon as possible. In this point we are generating documents in the behind and giving from here. Also we have singular get mechanism and showing orignal code with some actions in this page.


<Warning>If you see None for an element in libraries its caused from permissions. A user should try to click to element and after the first click the system will generate the document in the backend.</Warning>


## Singular Get Command


This code is for getting justs one element for more fast and efficient API communications. You should check the [upsonic.load](/client/using/load#upsonic-load) function for that.
