Upsonic On-Prem is designed to be work with read and write permissions on API, also the dashboard is gathering the informations from API and with logged in user access key. So you must to use seting `READ` and `WRITE` permissions for gathering information and making operations and for dump&load functions.


Also we have `enabled` and `is_admin` booleans and the **admins doesnt have any limits* so you must be careful about that. And when you disabled a user the user will lose whole permissions. After the enablation everything come back to the configuration and permissions.

## Viewing the users

You can make `enable`, `disable` `set_admin`,`unset_admin` operations and `delete` operations as well. Also when you want to make some edits like viewing access key and changing password, you can use `edit` button.


<Warning>You cannot make any change or deletion to the Robust Admin. Its defined from the beginning and the [configuration](/on-prem/getting_started/install_on_prem#deployment).</Warning>

## Editing a user

When you clicked to `Edit` you will see this section and you are able to these operations:

- Name, surname and username change
- Password change

- Adding or removing read permissions to libraries
- Adding or removing write permissions to libraries


### Permissions
Upsonic On-Prem have scope based permission for easily management and onboarding. When you add `math.sum` to read scopes of an user the user can easily read and get the function. Write permissions also same as reads, when you give the user can make dumps. Also we are supporting the `asterisk` (*) so when you use `math.*` for an user, user will be able to use permissions to all sub elements of math.


<Warning>If you see None document for an element in libraries its caused from permissions. A user should try to click to element and after the first click the system will generate the document in the backend.</Warning>
